A simple money management app that uses googlefirebase for backend services and flutter framework.
The app simply uses crud operations to create, add and delete the trasactions.
It has two sections of trasaction that are income and expenditure. It uses pie and bar chart to show the expending habit.
This app is certified by coding club of IIT Guwahati, as it was the coding club summer project.
This app has a unique feature of fetching the message of the user and finding out the wether it's credited or debited from the bank.
It supports multiple bank accounts, but the sms auto detection only works for SBI bank as it is manually text processed.
I will be using gpt-3.5 or some other model in future to smartly process the trasaction of any type of bank..
